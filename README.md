## üîß How to Install SG10208 Switch

1. **Mount the Switch** in a rack or place it on a secure desktop surface.
2. **Connect SFP Modules** into any of the 8 fiber ports.
3. **Insert Ethernet cable** into the RJ45 copper uplink port (10/100/1000 Mbps).
4. **Power the switch** using the included AC adapter (check the **power requirements for SFP switches**).
5. Access the **Web-managed SFP switch setup** GUI via the RJ45 uplink port (default IP: 192.168.1.1).

## ‚öôÔ∏è SFP Switch Configuration Guide

### VLAN Setup on SG10208

- Login to the web interface.
- Navigate to the **VLAN Configuration** tab.
- Define static VLAN IDs and assign ports.
- Tag/untag ports based on your VLAN architecture.

### RJ45 to SFP Configuration

- Ensure matching duplex and speed settings on both ends.
- If using **multi-mode SFP**, confirm fiber type compatibility.
- Set **auto-negotiation** or **manual speed config** in the Web UI.

### SNMP Configuration for Fiber Switches

- Enable SNMPv1/v2c from the Web GUI.
- Set community string (e.g., public/private).
- Allow IP addresses permitted to monitor the switch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fiber Switch Cabling Setup

- Use **LC or SC connectors** (based on SFP model).
- Match **single-mode/multi-mode SFPs** with appropriate fiber cables.
- Keep fiber distances under supported range (usually 2‚Äì20 km).
- Use dust caps when ports are not in use.

## üß† SFP Switch Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                            | Solution                                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| No link light on SFP port        | Check SFP compatibility and fiber cable orientation          |
| VLANs not working                | Confirm tagged/untagged port setup                           |
| RJ45 port not connecting         | Verify Ethernet speed/duplex setting                         |
| SNMP unreachable                 | Verify SNMP access IP, port, and firewall                    |
| Slow data transfer               | Check for fiber attenuation and port congestion              |
